# Optimal_control_examples
Contains implementation of optimal control algorithms for various dynamical Systems. Till now I have added the following systems:
1) Cartpole problem and its pole placment, LQR stabilisation
2) Tracker Trailer parking using Differential Dynamic Programming
3) Implemented Model Predicitve Controller for Drift dynamics of car. Its implemented in CasADi
4) Implementation of Closed Loop Steering of Unicycle-like Vehicles via Lyapunov Techniques
